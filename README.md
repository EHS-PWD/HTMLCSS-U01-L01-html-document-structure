### Unit 01 - Lesson 01: Document Structure

#### **Objective:**

After learning about the Doctype Declaration, HTML Tag, Head Tag, Body Tag, and Title Tag, students will apply these concepts by creating a basic HTML document. This assignment will help demonstrate their understanding of the foundational structure of an HTML document.

### **Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. **Create a New HTML File:**

   - [ ] Create a new file and save it as `index.html`. Make sure the file extension is `.html` to recognize it as an HTML document.

2. **Add the Doctype Declaration:**

   - [ ] At the very top of your document, type the following line to declare the document as HTML5:
     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     ```

3. **Create the HTML Tag:**

   - [ ] Below the Doctype declaration, add the opening and closing `<html>` tag:
     ```html
     <html></html>
     ```

4. **Set Up the Head Section and Title:**

   - [ ] In between the opening and closing `<html>` tag, add the opening and closing `<head>` tag. This section will include metadata about your document, title, and link resources:
     ```html
     <head></head>
     ```
   - [ ] In between the opening and closing `<head>` tag, include a opening and closing `<title>` tag to give your webpage a title:
     ```html
     <title>My First Web Page</title>
     ```

5. **Set Up the Body Section:**

   - [ ] Below the closing `</head>` tag, add the opening and closing `<body>` tag. This is where the visible content of your webpage will go:
     ```html
     <body></body>
     ```
   - [ ] Going forward, all content will go in between the opening and closing `<body>` tag. Add a heading using the `<h1>` tag with the text: "Welcome to My Web Page"
     ```html
     <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
     ```
   - [ ] After the `<h1>` tag, add a paragraph using the `<p>` tag with a brief description of your webpage:
     ```html
     <p>
       This is a simple web page created to demonstrate my understanding of
       basic HTML structure.
     </p>
     ```

6. **Save Your Work:**

   - [ ] Save the file as `index.html`.

7. **Test Your HTML Document:**

   - [ ] Open the saved `index.html` file in Google Chrome browser.
   - [ ] Ensure that the title “My First Web Page” appears in the browser’s tab, and the heading "Welcome to My Web Page" and paragraph are displayed correctly on the page.

8. **Submit Your Work:**
   - [ ] Once you have verified that your page displays correctly, submit the `index.html` file to the class assignment folder or through the school’s learning management system.
